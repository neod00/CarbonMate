Introduction
Climate change arising from anthropogenic activity has been identified as one of the greatest challenges 
facing the world and will continue to affect business and citizens over future decades.
Climate change has implications for both human and natural systems and could lead to significant 
impacts on resource availability, economic activity and human wellbeing. In response, international, 
regional, national and local initiatives are being developed and implemented by public and private 
sectors to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the Earth’s atmosphere as well as to 
facilitate adaptation to climate change.
There is a need for an effective and progressive response to the urgent threat of climate change 
on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge. ISO produces documents that support the 
transformation of scientific knowledge into tools that will help address climate change.
GHG initiatives on mitigation rely on the quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification of GHG 
emissions and/or removals.
The ISO 14060 family provides clarity and consistency for quantifying, monitoring, reporting and 
validating or verifying GHG emissions and removals to support sustainable development through a 
low-carbon economy. It also benefits organizations, project proponents and stakeholders worldwide 
by providing clarity and consistency on quantifying, monitoring, reporting, and validating or verifying 
GHG emissions and removals. Specifically, the use of the ISO 14060 family:
— enhances the environmental integrity of GHG quantification;
— enhances the credibility, consistency, and transparency of GHG quantification, monitoring, 
reporting, validation and verification;
— facilitates the development and implementation of GHG management strategies and plans;
— facilitates the development and implementation of mitigation actions through emission reductions 
or removal enhancements;
— facilitates the ability to track performance and progress in the reduction of GHG emissions and/or 
increase in GHG removals.
Applications of the ISO 14060 family include:
— corporate decisions, such as identifying GHG emission reduction opportunities and increasing 
profitability by reducing energy consumption;
— carbon risk management, such as the identification and management of risks and opportunities;
— voluntary initiatives, such as participation in voluntary GHG registries or sustainability reporting 
initiatives;
— GHG markets, such as the buying and selling of GHG allowances or credits;
— regulatory/government GHG programmes, such as credit for early action, agreements or national 
and local reporting initiatives.
ISO 14064‑1 details principles and requirements for designing, developing, managing and reporting 
organization‑level GHG inventories.
It includes requirements for determining GHG emission and removal boundaries, quantifying an 
organization’s GHG emissions and removals, and identifying specific company actions or activities 
aimed at improving GHG management.
It also includes requirements and guidance on inventory quality management, reporting, internal 
auditing and the organization’s responsibilities in verification activities.

ISO 14067:2018
ISO 14064‑2 details principles and requirements for determining baselines and for the monitoring, 
quantifying and reporting of project emissions. It focuses on GHG projects or project-based activities 
specifically designed to reduce GHG emissions and/or enhance GHG removals. It provides the basis for 
GHG projects to be validated and verified.
ISO 14064-3 details requirements for verifying GHG statements related to GHG inventories, GHG projects, 
and carbon footprints of products. It describes the process for validation or verification, including 
validation or verification planning, assessment procedures, and the evaluation of organizational, 
project and product GHG statements. 
ISO 14065 defines requirements for bodies that validate and verify GHG statements. Its requirements 
cover impartiality, competence, communication, validation and verification processes, appeals, 
complaints, and the management system of validation and verification bodies. It can be used as a 
basis for accreditation and other forms of recognition in relation to the impartiality, competence, and 
consistency of validation and verification bodies.
ISO 14066 specifies competence requirements for validation teams and verification teams. It includes 
principles and specifies competence requirements based on the tasks that validation teams or 
verification teams must be able to perform.
This document defines the principles, requirements and guidelines for the quantification of the carbon 
footprint of products. The aim of this document is to quantify GHG emissions associated with the life 
cycle stages of a product, beginning with resource extraction and raw material sourcing and extending 
through the production, use and end ‑of‑life stages of the product.
ISO/TR 14069 assists users in the application of ISO 14064‑1, providing guidelines and examples for 
improving transparency in the quantification of emissions and their reporting. It does not provide 
additional guidance to ISO 14064‑1.

NOTE In this document, GHG statements are the CFP or the partial CFP.
GHGs can be emitted and removed throughout the life cycle of a product which includes acquisition 
of raw material, design, production, transportation/delivery, use and the end-of-life treatment. 
Quantification of the carbon footprint of a product (CFP) will assist in the understanding and action to 
increase GHG removals and reduce GHG emissions throughout the life cycle of a product. This document 
details principles, requirements and guidelines for the quantification of CFPs, i.e. goods and services, 
based on GHG emissions and removals over their life cycle. Requirements and guidelines for the 
quantification of a partial CFP are also provided. Communication related to the CFP or the partial CFP 
is covered in ISO 14026. The development of product category rules (PCR) is covered in ISO/TS 14027.
This document is based on principles, requirements and guidelines identified in existing International 
Standards on life cycle assessment (LCA), ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, and aims to set specific 
requirements for the quantification of a CFP and a partial CFP.
This document is expected to benefit organizations, governments, industry, service providers, 
communities and other interested parties by providing clarity and consistency in quantifying CFPs. 
Specifically, using LCA in accordance with this document, with climate change as the single impact 
category, can offer benefits through:
— avoiding burden-shifting from one stage of a product life cycle to another or between product 
life cycles;
— providing requirements for the quantification of the CFP;
— facilitating CFP performance tracking in reducing GHG emissions;
— providing a better understanding of the CFP such that potential opportunities for increases in GHG 
removals and reductions of GHG emissions might be identified;
— helping to promote a sustainable low carbon economy;
— enhancing the credibility, consistency and transparency of the quantification and reporting of the CFP;
— facilitating the evaluation of alternative product design and sourcing options, production and 
manufacturing methods, raw material choices, transportation, recycling and other end-of-
life processes;
— facilitating the development and implementation of GHG management strategies and plans across 
product life cycles, as well as the detection of additional efficiencies in the supply chain;
— preparing reliable CFP information.
NOTE In respect to the terminology of ISO 14026 regarding footprint communication, climate change is 
considered as an example of an “area of concern”.
Figure 2 illustrates the connection between this document and standards outside the GHG management 
family of standards.

4 Application
Possible applications of this document include the provision of information for research and 
development of products, improvement of technologies, CFP performance tracking and communication.
This document facilitates communication of a CFP and partial CFP in accordance with ISO 14026.
5 Principles
5.1 General
These principles are fundamental and are the basis for the subsequent requirements in this document.
5.2 Life cycle perspective
The quantification of a CFP takes into consideration the entire life cycle of a product, including acquisition 
of raw material, design, production, transportation/delivery, use and the end-of-life treatment.
NOTE 1 This subclause is adapted from ISO 14040:2006, 4.1.2.
NOTE 2 Through such a systematic overview and life cycle perspective, the shifting of a potential impact 
between life cycle stages or individual processes can be identified and possibly avoided.

ISO 14067:2018
5.3 Relative approach and functional or declared unit
The CFP study is structured around a functional unit (CFP) or a declared unit (partial CFP) and the 
results are calculated relative to this functional unit or declared unit.
NOTE This subclause is adapted from ISO 14040:2006, 4.1.4.
5.4 Iterative approach
An iterative approach of reassessment is taken when applying the four phases of LCA (goal and scope 
definition, LCI, LCIA and life cycle interpretation, see 6.3 to 6.6) to a CFP study. The iterative approach 
contributes to the consistency of the CFP study and the reported results.
NOTE This subclause is adapted from ISO 14040:2006, 4.1.5.
5.5 Priority of scientific approach
Preference to natural science (such as physics, chemistry, biology) is given when making decisions in 
the CFP study. If this is not possible, other scientific approaches (such as social and economic sciences) 
or approaches contained in international conventions relevant and valid within the geographical scope 
as defined in 6.3.2 are used. Only if neither a natural scientific basis exists nor a justification based 
on other scientific approaches or international conventions is possible are decisions based on value 
choices permitted.
NOTE 1 For more information on the allocation procedure, see 6.4.6.2 .
NOTE 2 This subclause is adapted from ISO 14040:2006, 4.1.8.
5.6 Relevance
The selection of data and methods is appropriate to the assessment of the GHG emissions and removals 
arising from the system under study.
5.7 Completeness
All GHG emissions and removals that provide a significant contribution to the CFP or partial CFP of the 
product system under study are included. The level of significance is determined by the cut-off criteria 
(see 6.3.4.3).
5.8 Consistency
Assumptions, methods and data are applied in the same way throughout the CFP study to arrive at 
conclusions in accordance with the goal and scope definition.
5.9 Coherence
Methodologies, standards and guidance documents that are already recognized internationally and 
adopted for product categories are applied, to enhance comparability between CFPs within any specific 
product category.
5.10 Accuracy
Quantification of the CFP and partial CFP is accurate, verifiable, relevant and not misleading, and bias 
and uncertainties are reduced as far as is practical.

5.11 Transparency
All relevant issues are addressed and documented in an open, comprehensive and understandable 
presentation of information.
Any relevant assumptions are disclosed and methodologies and data sources used are appropriately 
referenced. Any estimates are clearly explained and bias is avoided so that the CFP study report 
represents what it purports to represent.
5.12 Avoidance of double-counting
Double-counting of GHG emissions and removals within the studied product system is avoided when 
the allocation of the same GHG emissions and removals occurs only once (see 6.4.6.1).
NOTE See the example given in 6.4.9.4.1.
6 Methodology for quantification of the CFP and partial CFP
6.1 General
A CFP study in accordance with this document shall include the four phases of LCA, i.e. goal and scope 
definition (see 6.3), LCI (see 6.4), LCIA (see 6.5) and life cycle interpretation (see 6.6), for CFP or partial 
CFP. The unit processes comprising the product system shall be grouped into life cycle stages, e.g. 
acquisition of raw material, design, production, transportation/delivery, use (see 6.3.7) and end‑of‑life 
(see 6.3.8). GHG emissions and removals from the product’s life cycle shall be assigned to the life cycle 
stage in which the GHG emissions and removals occur. Partial CFPs may be added together to quantify 
the CFP, provided that they are performed according to the same methodology for the same timeframe 
and that no gaps or overlaps exist.
NOTE As an example from the construction sector, it is possible to have a partial CFP for a substance or 
preparation (e.g. cement), for a bulk product (e.g. gravel), for a service (e.g. maintenance of a building) or for an 
assembled system (e.g. masonry wall).
An organization may develop a CFP systematic approach. If it does, it shall be developed in accordance 
with Annex C.
6.2 Use of CFP–PCR
Where relevant PCR or CFP–PCR exist, they shall be adopted. PCR or CFP–PCR are relevant provided:
— they have been developed in accordance with ISO/TS 14027, or a relevant sector-specific International 
Standard that applies the requirements of ISO 14044;
— they conform to the requirements of this clause, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5;
— they are considered proper (e.g. for system boundaries, modularity, allocation and data quality) by 
the organization applying this document and are in accordance with the principles in Clause 5.
NOTE Examples of organizations that apply this document are providers of goods and services, practitioners 
and commissioners of the CFP study.
If more than one set of relevant PCR or CFP–PCR exist, the relevant PCR or CFP–PCR shall be reviewed 
by the organization applying this document (e.g. for system boundaries, modularity, allocation, data 
quality). The choice of the PCR or CFP–PCR adopted shall be justified.
When all requirements in this subclause are met by PCR, those PCR are equivalent to the CFP–PCR.
If CFP–PCR are adopted for the CFP study, the quantification shall be conducted according to the 
requirements in these CFP–PCR.

Where no relevant CFP–PCR exist, the requirements and guidance of other internationally agreed 
sector-specific documents, related to specific product or material categories, should be adopted if they 
conform to the requirements of this document and are considered appropriate by the organization 
applying this document.
6.3 Goal and scope definition
6.3.1 Goal of a CFP study
The overall goal of conducting a CFP study is to calculate the potential contribution of a product to 
global warming expressed as CO 2e by quantifying all significant GHG emissions and removals over the 
product’s life cycle or selected processes, in line with cut-off criteria (see 6.3.4.3).
NOTE 1 This quantification supports a range of objectives and applications, including, but not limited to, 
individual studies, comparative studies in accordance with Annex B and performance tracking over time, and is 
intended for a range of audiences.
In defining the goal of a CFP study, the following items shall be unambiguously stated:
— the intended application;
— the reasons for carrying out the CFP study;
— the intended audience;
— the intended communication, if any, of the CFP or partial CFP information, in accordance 
with ISO 14026.
NOTE 2 This subclause is adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.2.2.
6.3.2 Scope of a CFP study
The scope of a CFP study shall be consistent with the goal of the CFP study (see 6.3.1).
In defining the scope of the CFP study, the following items shall be considered and clearly described, 
taking into account the requirements and guidance given in the relevant subclauses of this document:
a) the system under study and its functions;
b) the functional or declared unit (see 6.3.3);
c) the system boundary, including the geographical scope of the system under study (see 6.3.4);
d) data and data quality requirements (see 6.3.5);
e) the time boundary for data (see 6.3.6);
f) assumptions, especially for the use stage and the end-of-life stage (see 6.3.7 and 6.3.8);
g) allocation procedures (see 6.4.6);
h) specific GHG emissions and removals (see 6.4.9), e.g. due to LUC (see 6.4.9.5);
i) methods to address issues occurring with specific product categories (see 6.4.9);
j) the CFP study report (see Clause 7);
k) the type of critical review, if any (see Clause 8);
l) limitations of the CFP study (see Annex A).
If a comparison is undertaken, the requirements in Annex B shall be followed.

ISO 14067:2018
In some cases, the scope of the CFP study may be revised due to unforeseen limitations, constraints 
or as a result of additional information. Such modifications, together with their explanation, shall 
be documented.
NOTE This subclause is adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.2.3.1.
6.3.3 Functional or declared unit
A CFP study shall clearly specify the functional or declared unit of the system under study. The 
functional or declared unit shall be consistent with the goal and scope of the CFP study. The primary 
purpose of a functional or declared unit is to provide a reference to which the inputs and outputs are 
related. Therefore, the functional or declared unit shall be clearly defined and measurable.
The declared unit shall only be used in a partial CFP.
When CFP–PCR are adopted, the functional or declared unit used shall be that defined in the CFP–PCR.
Having chosen the functional or declared unit, the associated reference flow shall be defined.
When a comparison is done between product systems, it shall be made on the basis of the same 
functional unit(s). Comparisons based on partial carbon footprint (declared unit) are permitted if the 
omitted life cycle stages are identical (see Annex B). Comparison based on the declared unit may only 
be used for business-to-business purposes. If additional functions of any of the product systems are 
not taken into account in the comparison of functional units, then these omissions shall be explained 
and documented. As an alternative to this approach, systems associated with the delivery of these 
functions may be added to the boundary of the other product system to make the product systems 
more comparable. In these cases, the processes selected shall be explained and documented.
NOTE 1 The choice of the functional or the declared unit and the associated reference flow require special 
attention, e.g. in order to allow comparisons without bias (see also Annex B).
EXAMPLE 1 In the function of drying hands, both a paper towel and an air-dryer system are studied. The 
selected functional unit can be expressed in terms of the identical number of pairs of hands dried for both 
systems. For each system, it is possible to determine the reference flow, e.g. the average mass of paper or the 
average volume of hot air required to dry one pair of hands, respectively. For both systems, it is possible to 
compile an inventory of inputs and outputs on the basis of the reference flows. At its simplest level, in the case of 
paper towel, this would be related to the paper consumed. In the case of the air-dryer, this would be related to the 
volume and temperature of hot air needed to dry the hands.
NOTE 2 The example above is taken from ISO 14040:2006, 5.2.2, with modifications.
EXAMPLE 2 The functional unit of a tonne of steel cannot be determined because a tonne of steel can 
be transformed to various products which can fulfil various functions. In this case, use of declared unit is 
appropriate.
6.3.4 System boundary
6.3.4.1 General
The system boundary shall be the basis used to determine which unit processes are included within 
the CFP study.
Where CFP–PCR are used (see 6.2), their requirements on the processes to be included shall also apply.
The selection of the system boundary shall be consistent with the goal of the CFP study. The criteria, e.g. 
cut‑off criteria (see 6.3.4.3), used in establishing the system boundary shall be identified and explained.
Decisions shall be made regarding which unit processes to include in the CFP study and to which level 
of detail these unit processes shall be studied. The exclusion of life cycle stages, processes, inputs or 
outputs within the system under study is only permitted if they do not significantly change the overall 
conclusions of the CFP study. Any decisions to exclude life cycle stages, processes, inputs or outputs

shall be clearly stated and the reasons and implications for their exclusion shall be explained. The 
threshold for significance shall be stated, e.g. as cut-off criteria (see 6.3.4.3), and justified.
EXAMPLE Capital goods can be excluded in accordance with the goal and scope if their exclusion is not 
expected to significantly alter the conclusions according to specified criteria.
Decisions made regarding which unit processes, inputs and outputs shall be included and the level of 
detail of the quantification of the CFP shall be clearly stated.
NOTE 1 The first five paragraphs of this subclause are adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.2.3.3.
The CFP and the partial CFP shall not include carbon offsetting.
NOTE 2 GHG removals that are not linked to carbon offsetting can occur within the system boundary of the 
product system.
6.3.4.2 Setting the system boundary
Quantification carried out in accordance with this document shall include all GHG emissions and 
removals of those unit processes that are part of the product system that have the potential to make a 
significant contribution to the CFP or the partial CFP (see 6.3.4.1).
Within the goal and scope definition phase, consistent criteria shall be defined:
— for which unit processes a detailed assessment is needed due to an expected significant contribution 
to the CFP or the partial CFP;
— for which unit processes the quantification of GHG emissions may be based on secondary data if the 
collection of primary data are not possible or practicable (see 6.3.5);
— which unit processes may be merged, e.g. all transport processes within a plant.
6.3.4.3 Cut-off criteria
In general, all processes and flows that are attributable to the analysed system shall be included. If 
individual material or energy flows are found to be insignificant for the carbon footprint of a particular 
unit process, these may be excluded for practical reasons and shall be reported as data exclusions. 
Consistent cut ‑off criteria that allow the exclusion of certain processes of minor importance shall be 
defined within the goal and scope definition phase.
The effect of the selected cut-off criteria on the outcome of the study shall also be assessed and 
described in the CFP study report (see 6.4.5 and 6.6).
NOTE For additional guidance on cut-off criteria, see ISO 14044:2006, 4.2.3.3.3.
6.3.5 Data and data quality
Site-specific data shall be collected for individual processes where the organization undertaking the 
CFP study has financial or operational control. The data shall be representative of the processes for 
which they are collected. Site-specific data should also be used for those unit processes that are most 
important and not under financial or operational control.
NOTE 1 The most important processes are those which together contribute at least 80 % to the CFP, starting 
from the largest to the smallest contributions after cut ‑off.
NOTE 2 Site-specific data refer to either direct GHG emissions (determined through direct monitoring, 
stoichiometry, mass balance or similar methods), activity data (inputs and outputs of processes that result in 
GHG emissions or removals) or emission factors. Site-specific data can be collected from a specific site, or can 
be averaged across all sites that contain the process within the system under study. They can be measured or 
modelled, as long as the result is specific to the process in the product’s life cycle.

ISO 14067:2018
Primary data that are not site-specific data, and which have undergone third-party review, should be 
used when the collection of site-specific data is not practicable.
Secondary data shall only be used for inputs and outputs where the collection of primary data is not 
practicable, or for processes of minor importance.
NOTE 3 In some cases, default emission factors as secondary data are not life cycle based emission factors and 
might require adaptation or modification.
Secondary data shall be justified and documented with references in the CFP study report.
A CFP study should use data that reduce bias and uncertainty as far as practical by using the best 
quality data available. Data quality shall be characterized by both quantitative and qualitative aspects. 
Characterization of data quality should address the following:
a) time‑related coverage: age of data and the minimum length of time over which data should 
be collected;
b) geographical coverage: geographical area from which data for unit processes should be collected to 
satisfy the goal of the CFP study;
c) technology coverage: specific technology or technology mix;
d) precision: measure of the variability of each data value expressed (e.g. variance);
e) completeness: percentage of total flow that is measured or estimated;
f) representativeness: qualitative assessment of the degree to which the data set reflects the true 
population of interest (i.e. geographical coverage, time period and technology coverage);
g) consistency: qualitative assessment of whether or not the study methodology is applied uniformly 
to the various components of the sensitivity analysis;
h) reproducibility: qualitative assessment of the extent to which information about the methodology 
and data values would allow an independent practitioner to reproduce the results reported in 
the CFP study;
i) sources of the data; 
j) uncertainty of the information.
NOTE 4 The numbered list above is adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.2.3.6.2.
A two-step approach shall be taken for the data quality evaluation:
— the data quality requirements according to items a) to d) above shall be characterized for 
the CFP study;
— data shall be assessed with respect to the requirements for items a) to d) above.
NOTE 5 Data quality requirements are a mandatory part of CFP–PCR (see 6.2).
NOTE 6 Data quality requirements might differ for different types of data.
Organizations undertaking a CFP study should have a system to manage and retain data. They should 
seek to continuously improve the consistency and quality of their data and control of documented 
information.
6.3.6 Time boundary for data
The time boundary for data is the time period for which the quantified figure for the CFP is 
representative.

ISO 14067:2018
The time period for which the CFP is representative shall be specified and justified.
The choice of the time period for data collection should consider intra- and inter-annual variability and, 
when possible, use values representing the trend over the selected period. Where the GHG emissions 
and removals associated with specific unit processes within the life cycle of a product vary over time, 
data shall be collected over a time period appropriate to establish the average GHG emissions and 
removals associated with the life cycle of the product.
If a process within the system boundary is linked to a specific time period (e.g. seasonal products such 
as fruit and vegetables), the assessment of GHG emissions and removals shall cover that particular 
period in the life cycle of the product. Any activity (or activities) occurring outside that period shall also 
be included provided that it is within the product system (e.g. GHG emissions related to a tree nursery). 
These data on GHG emissions and removals shall be related to the functional or declared unit.
6.3.7 Use stage and use profile
When the use stage is included within the scope of the CFP study (see 6.3.2), GHG emissions and 
removals arising from the use stage of the product shall be included. The user of the product and the 
use profile of the product shall be specified in the CFP study.
NOTE The use stage starts when the specified user takes possession of the finished product and ends when 
the product is ready for disposal, reuse for a different function, recycling or energy recovery.
Service life information shall be verifiable. It shall refer to the intended use conditions and to the 
related functions of the product. The use profile should seek to represent the actual usage pattern in 
the selected market.
Where not otherwise justified, the determination of the use profile (i.e. scenarios for service life and 
the selected market) shall be based on published technical information, such as:
a) CFP–PCR (see 6.2);
b) published International Standards that specify guidance and requirements for development of 
scenarios and service life for the use stage for the product being assessed;
c) published national guidelines that specify guidance for development of scenarios and service life 
for the use stage for the product being assessed;
d) published industry guidelines that specify guidance for development of scenarios and service life 
for the use stage for the product being assessed;
e) use profiles based on documented usage patterns for the product in the selected market.
Where no method for determining the use profile of products has been established in accordance with 
a) to e) above, the assumptions made in determining the use profile of products shall be established by 
the organization carrying out the CFP study. A sensitivity analysis shall be undertaken if the use stage 
assumption is shown to be significant for the conclusions of the CFP study.
The manufacturer’s recommendation for proper use (e.g. cooking in an oven at a specified temperature 
for a specified time) might provide a basis for determining the use profile of a product. The actual usage 
pattern might, however, differ from those recommended. Any difference should be explained.
All relevant assumptions for the use stage shall be documented in the CFP study report.
6.3.8 End-of-life stage
NOTE 1 The end-of-life stage begins when the used product under study is ready for disposal, recycling, reuse 
for different purposes or energy recovery.

ISO 14067:2018
All the GHG emissions and removals arising from the end ‑of‑life stage of a product shall be included in a 
CFP study, if this stage is included in the scope (see 6.3.2). End-of-life processes may include:
a) collection, packaging and transport of end-of-life products;
b) preparation for recycling and reuse;
c) dismantling of components from end-of-life products;
d) shredding and sorting;
e) material recycling;
f) organic recovery (e.g. composting and anaerobic digestion);
g) energy recovery or other recovery processes;
h) incineration and sorting of bottom ash;
i) landfilling, landfill maintenance and promoting emissions from decomposition, such as methane.
NOTE 2 For end-of-life processes, CFP–PCR can provide additional guidance.
All relevant assumptions regarding end ‑of‑life treatment, shall be:
— based on best available information;
— based on current technology;
— documented in the CFP study report.
End-of-life scenarios shall reflect the current market and be representative of one of the most likely 
alternatives, or more than one scenario (including future scenarios) may be assessed. The scenarios 
will allow users to scale the results to assess realistic options.
6.4 Life cycle inventory analysis for the CFP
6.4.1 General
LCI is the phase of LCA involving the compilation and quantification of inputs and outputs for a product 
throughout its life cycle.
After the goal and scope definition phase, the LCI of a CFP study shall be conducted. This consists of the 
following steps, adapted from ISO 14044, which shall apply when relevant:
a) data collection;
b) validation of data;
c) relating data to unit process and functional or declared unit;
d) refining the system boundary;
e) allocation.
Special provisions in this document apply for:
— CFP performance tracking;
— the time period for the assessment of GHG emissions and removals;
— the treatment of specific GHG emissions and removals.

ISO 14067:2018
If CFP–PCR are adopted for the CFP study, the LCI shall be conducted according to the requirements in 
the CFP–PCR.
6.4.2 Data collection
The qualitative and quantitative data for inclusion in the life cycle inventory shall be collected for all 
unit processes that are included in the system under study. The collected data, whether measured, 
calculated or estimated, are used to quantify the inputs and outputs of a unit process. Significant unit 
processes shall be documented in the CFP study report.
For those data that might be significant for the conclusions of the CFP study, details about the relevant 
data collection process, the time when data have been collected, and further information about data 
quality shall be referenced. If such data do not meet the data quality requirements, this shall be stated.
Since data collection can span several locations and published references, a representative and 
consistent data set for the system under study should be used.
NOTE 1 This subclause is adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.3.2. For further guidance, see ISO 14044:2006, 4.3.2.2.
NOTE 2 For data and data quality, see 6.3.5.
6.4.3 Validation of data
A check on data validity shall be conducted during the process of data collection to confirm and provide 
evidence that the data quality requirements specified in 6.3.5 have been met.
Validation should involve establishing mass balances, energy balances and/or comparative analyses of 
emission factors or other appropriate methods. As each unit process obeys the laws of conservation of 
mass and energy, mass and energy balances provide a useful check on the validity of the description of 
a unit process.
NOTE This subclause is adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.3.3.2.
6.4.4 Relating data to unit process and functional or declared unit
An appropriate flow shall be determined for each unit process. The quantitative input and output data 
of the unit process shall be calculated in relation to this flow.
Based on the flow chart and the flows between unit processes, the flows of all unit processes are related 
to the reference flow. The calculation shall relate system input and output data to the functional or 
declared unit.
Care should be taken when aggregating the inputs and outputs in the product system. The level of 
aggregation shall be consistent with the goal of the CFP study. If more detailed aggregation rules are 
required, they should be explained in the goal and scope definition phase of the CFP study or should be 
left to a subsequent LCIA phase.
NOTE This subclause is adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.3.3.3.
6.4.5 Refining the system boundary
Reflecting the iterative nature of the quantification of the CFP, if no CFP–PCR are used, decisions 
regarding the data to be included or excluded shall be based on a sensitivity analysis to determine the 
significance. The initial system boundary shall be revised, as appropriate, in accordance with the cut-
off criteria established in the goal and scope definition phase. The results of this refining process and 
the sensitivity analysis shall be documented in the CFP study report.
The refining of the system boundary based on a sensitivity analysis as described above may result in
a) exclusion of life cycle stages or unit processes when lack of significance can be shown,

b) exclusion of inputs and outputs that lack significance to the results of the CFP study, or
c) inclusion of new unit processes, inputs and outputs that are shown to be significant.
The refining of the system boundary serves to limit the subsequent data handling to those input and 
output data that are determined to be significant to the goal of the CFP study.
NOTE This subclause is adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.3.3.4.
6.4.6 Allocation
6.4.6.1 General
The inputs and outputs shall be allocated to the different products according to the clearly stated and 
justified allocation procedure.
The sum of the allocated inputs and outputs of a unit process shall be equal to the inputs and outputs of 
the unit process before allocation.
Whenever several alternative allocation procedures are applicable, a sensitivity analysis shall be 
conducted to illustrate the consequences of the departure from the selected approach.
When PCR or CFP–PCR are developed in accordance with ISO/TS 14027, no further sensitivity analysis 
shall be required.
NOTE This subclause is partly adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.3.4.2.
6.4.6.2 Allocation procedure
The CFP study shall include the identification of the processes shared with other product systems and 
deal with them in accordance with the stepwise procedure presented below.
NOTE Formally, step 1 is not part of the allocation procedure.
a) Step 1: Wherever possible, allocation should be avoided by
1) dividing the unit process to be allocated into two or more sub-processes separately and 
collecting the input and output data related to these sub ‑processes, or
2) expanding the product system to include the additional functions related to the co-products.
b) Step 2: Where allocation cannot be avoided, the inputs and outputs of the system should be 
partitioned between its different products or functions in a way that reflects the underlying 
physical relationships between them.
c) Step 3: Where physical relationship alone cannot be established or used as the basis for allocation, 
the inputs should be allocated between the products and the functions in a way that reflects other 
relationships between them. For example, input and output data might be allocated between co-
products in proportion to the economic value of the products.
When outputs include both co ‑products and waste, the ratio between co ‑products and waste shall be 
identified and the inputs and outputs shall be allocated to the co-products only. Allocation procedures 
shall be uniformly applied to similar inputs and outputs of the product under study. For example, if 
allocation is made to usable products (e.g. intermediate or discarded products) leaving the system, 
then the allocation procedure shall be similar to the allocation procedure used for such products 
entering the system.
The life cycle inventory is based on material balances between input and output. Allocation procedures 
should therefore approximate, as much as possible, such fundamental input/output relationships and 
characteristics.

NOTE 2 For allocation procedures, CFP–PCR can provide additional guidance.
6.4.6.3 Allocation procedure for reuse and recycling
The allocation principles and procedures in 6.4.6.1 and 6.4.6.2 also apply to reuse and recycling situations.
Changes in the inherent properties of materials shall be taken into account. In addition, particularly for 
the recovery processes between the original and subsequent product system, the system boundary shall 
be identified and explained, ensuring that the allocation principles are observed as described in 6.4.6.2.
However, in these situations, additional elaboration is needed for the following reasons:
— reuse and recycling (as well as composting, energy recovery and other processes that can be 
assimilated to reuse/recycling) may imply that the inputs and outputs associated with unit processes 
for extraction and processing of raw material or final disposal of products are to be shared by more 
than one product system;
— reuse and recycling may change the inherent properties of materials in subsequent use.
Specific care should be taken when defining the system boundary with regard to recovery processes.
Several allocation procedures are applicable for reuse and recycling. The application of some procedures 
is distinguished in the following to illustrate how the above constraints can be addressed.
a) A closed-loop allocation procedure applies to closed-loop product systems. It also applies to open-
loop product systems where no changes occur in the inherent properties of the recycled material. 
In such cases, the need for allocation is avoided since the use of secondary material displaces the 
use of virgin (primary) material. However, the first use of virgin material in applicable open-loop 
product systems may follow an open-loop allocation procedure outlined in b).
b) An open-loop allocation procedure applies to open-loop product systems where the material is 
recycled into other product systems and the material undergoes a change to its inherent properties.
The allocation procedures for the shared unit processes should use, as the basis for allocation, the 
following order, if feasible:
— physical properties (e.g. mass);
— economic value (e.g. market value of the scrap material or recycled material in relation to market 
value of primary material); or
— the number of subsequent uses of the recycled material.
NOTE 1 An example how to treat recycling in LCA studies is given in Annex D.
NOTE 2 This subclause is adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.3.4.3.
6.4.7 CFP performance tracking
When the CFP is intended to be used for CFP performance tracking, the following additional 
requirements for the quantification of the CFP shall be met:
a) the assessments shall be carried out for different points in time;
b) the change to the CFP over time shall be calculated for products with an identical functional or 
declared unit;
c) the change to the CFP over time shall be calculated using the same method and, if used, the 
same PCR, for all subsequent assessments (e.g. systems for selecting and managing data, system 
boundaries, allocation, identical characterization factors).

The time period between the points in time for which the CFP performance tracking is undertaken shall 
not be shorter than the time boundary for data as described in 6.3.6. It shall be described in the goal 
and scope of the CFP study.
6.4.8 Assessing the effect of the timing of GHG emissions and removals
All GHG emissions and removals shall be calculated as if released or removed at the beginning of the 
assessment period without taking into account an effect of delayed GHG emissions and removals.
Where GHG emissions and removals arising from the use stage (see 6.3.7) and/or from the end ‑of‑life 
stage (see 6.3.8) occur over more than 10 years (if not otherwise specified in the relevant PCR) after 
the product has been brought into use, the timing of GHG emissions and removals relative to the year 
of production of the product shall be specified in the life cycle inventory. The effect of timing of the 
GHG emissions and removals from the product system (as CO 2e), if calculated, shall be documented 
separately in the CFP study report. The method used to calculate the effect of timing shall be stated and 
justified in the CFP study report.
NOTE The time period of 10 years has been selected to avoid undue burden in data collection and additional 
reporting of GHG emissions and removals over shorter time periods and to achieve comparability in reporting. 
This value might be revised in future based on experience or improved scientific knowledge.
6.4.9 Treatment of specific GHG emissions and removals
6.4.9.1 General
For the sake of consistency of quantification, specific requirements and guidelines are provided in the 
following subclauses for specific GHG emissions and removals where different approaches could lead to 
different results. Additional requirements, guidelines and data might be available in relevant CFP–PCR, 
other sector guidance documents or footprint programmes.
6.4.9.2 Fossil and biogenic carbon
Fossil GHG emissions and removals shall be included in the CFP or the partial CFP and documented 
separately as a net result. Biogenic GHG emissions and removals shall be included in the CFP or the 
partial CFP and should each be expressed separately (see Figure 3).
NOTE 1 An example of fossil GHG removals is capture of fossil emissions from a power plant through a non ‑
biological process followed by storage through geosequestration.
All relevant unit processes of the life cycle of biomass-derived products shall be included in the system 
under study, including, but not limited to, cultivation, production and harvesting of biomass.
NOTE 2 Treatment of GHG emissions and removals associated with land use change and land use are described 
in 6.4.9.5 and 6.4.9.6.
NOTE 3 See Annex E for guidance related to agricultural and forestry products.
6.4.9.3 Biogenic carbon in products
NOTE 1 Biomass‑derived carbon contained in a product is referred to as the biogenic carbon content of 
the product.
When biogenic carbon is stored in a product for a specified time, this carbon shall be treated in 
accordance with the provisions in 6.4.8. If a product’s biogenic carbon content is calculated, it shall 
be documented separately in the CFP study report but it shall not be included in the result of CFP or 
partial CFP.

Information on biogenic carbon content shall be provided when performing cradle to gate studies, as this 
information may be relevant for the remaining value chain. For reporting requirements, see Clause 7.
NOTE 2 In the case of products containing biomass, the biogenic carbon content is equal to the carbon removal 
during plant growth. This biogenic carbon can be released in the end ‑of‑life stage.
6.4.9.4 Electricity
6.4.9.4.1 General
The GHG emissions associated with the use of electricity shall include:
— GHG emissions arising from the life cycle of the electricity supply system, such as upstream emissions 
(e.g. the mining and transport of fuel to the electricity generator or the growing and processing of 
biomass for use as a fuel);
— GHG emissions during generation of electricity, including losses during transmission and 
distribution;
— downstream emissions (e.g. the treatment of waste arising from the operation of nuclear electricity 
generators or treatment of ashes from coal fired electricity plants).
NOTE The same approach applies to purchased and sold heating and cooling energy and compressed air.
This document includes the principle of avoidance of double ‑counting in 5.12 and guidance concerning 
electricity in 6.4.9.4.2 to 6.4.9.4.4.
EXAMPLES No double-counting occurs:
— where the process that used the electricity and no other process may claim the generator-specific emission 
factors for that electricity;
— where the generator-specific electricity production does not influence the emission factors of any other 
process or organization.
6.4.9.4.2 Internally generated electricity
When electricity is internally generated (e.g. on-site generated electricity) and consumed for a product 
under study and no contractual instruments have been sold to a third party, then the life cycle data for 
that electricity shall be used for that product.
6.4.9.4.3 Electricity from a directly connected supplier
A GHG emission factor obtained from the organization’s supplier for the consumed electricity may be 
used if there is a dedicated transmission line between the organization and the generation plant from 
which the emission factor is derived, and no contractual instruments have been sold to a third party for 
that consumed electricity.
6.4.9.4.4 Electricity from the grid
Life cycle data from a supplier-specific electricity product shall be used when the supplier is able to 
guarantee through a contractual instrument that the electricity product:
— conveys the information associated with the unit of electricity delivered together with the 
characteristics of the generator;
— is assured with a unique claim (see 5.12);
— is tracked and redeemed, retired or cancelled by or on behalf of the reporting entity

— is as close as possible to the period to which the contractual instrument is applied and comprises a 
corresponding timespan;
— is produced within the country, or within the market boundaries where consumption occurs if the 
grid is interconnected.
If processes within the system under study are located in small island developing states (SIDS), the CFP 
or the partial CFP may additionally be quantified using contractual instruments for such processes, 
irrespective of grid inter-connectivity.
NOTE 1 SIDS are defined by the United Nations [20].
When information on supplier specific electricity is not available, GHG emissions associated with the 
relevant electricity grid from which the electricity is obtained shall be used. The relevant grid shall 
reflect the electricity consumption of the related region, excluding any previously claimed attributed 
electricity. In case no electricity tracking system is in place, the selected grid shall reflect the electricity 
consumption of the region.
NOTE 2 Contractual instruments are any type of contract between two parties for the sale and purchase of 
energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims.
EXAMPLE Contractual instruments can include energy attribute certificates, renewable energy certificates 
(RECs), guarantee of origin (GOs) or green energy certificates.
NOTE 3 Examples of the characteristics of a generator include the registered name of the facility, the owners 
and the nature of the energy generated, the generation capacity and the renewable energy supplied.
NOTE 4 If specific life cycle data on a process within the electricity supply system are difficult to access, data 
from recognized databases (e.g. through the UNEP or UNFCCC) can be used.
Some electricity attributes, such as green certificates are sold without direct coupling to the electricity 
itself. In some countries, parts of the electricity from renewable energy sources might be sold/exported 
as renewable electricity without being excluded from the supplied mix. For this reason, in such cases a 
sensitivity analysis applying the relevant consumption grid mix shall be conducted and reported in the 
CFP study report to demonstrate the difference in results of the electricity tracking instruments.
6.4.9.5 Land use change
The GHG emissions and removals occurring as a result of direct land use change (dLUC) within the 
last decades (see NOTE 1) shall be assessed in accordance with internationally recognized methods, 
such as the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories [17] and included in the CFP. The 
net dLUC GHG emissions and removals shall be documented separately in the CFP study report. If site-
specific data are applied, they shall be transparently documented in the CFP study report. If a national 
approach is used, the data shall be based on a verified study, a peer reviewed study or similar scientific 
evidence and shall be documented in the CFP study report.
NOTE 1 The IPCC tier 1 period of 20 years is frequently used.
When the process under assessment causes changes in carbon stocks compared to the reference land 
use, the GHG emissions and removals associated with these changes shall be documented and assigned 
to the system under study.
NOTE 2 “Changes in carbon stocks” refers to changes in soil carbon and changes in above ‑ and below‑ground 
biomass over time.
NOTE 3 The choice of reference land use can have a significant impact on the CFP and the partial CFP. Annex E 
provides guidance on choosing the reference land use.
The net changes shall be assigned to the system under study across the selected time period.

The time period selected for analysis shall be documented and justified. At a minimum, it shall include 
at least one full rotation period for processes that involve growing crops or trees.
NOTE 4 Wood from forest land that remains forest land has zero emissions in terms of LUC. For further 
guidance on LUC, see Annex E.
NOTE 5 National approaches can include government ‑recognized and published methods and calculators.
Indirect land use change (iLUC) should be included in CFP studies once an internationally agreed 
procedure exists.
All choices and assumptions, including applied methodologies, shall be justified and documented in the 
CFP study report.
NOTE 6 There is ongoing research to develop a methodology and data for the inclusion of iLUC in GHG reporting.
NOTE 7 LUC emissions do not arise only from production of agricultural and forestry products, e.g. in the 
context of deforestation or conversion of grassland to energy crops, but also from LUC for other product systems, 
e.g. related to the conversion of land to quarries, infrastructure and production plants.
NOTE 8 With respect to GHG emissions and removals connected to marine areas related to products, only 
very limited information is available.
6.4.9.6 Land use
GHG emissions and removals occurring as a result of land use through changes in soil and biomass 
carbon stocks that are not the result of changes to management of land should be assessed and included 
in the CFP. If changes in soil and biomass carbon stocks are not assessed, this decision shall be justified 
in the CFP study report. Where included, these emissions and removals shall be assessed in accordance 
with internationally recognized methods, such as the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories[17] and shall be documented separately in the CFP study report.
When changes in management of land cause changes in soil and biomass carbon stocks, compared 
with the reference land use, the GHG emissions and removals shall be documented and assigned to the 
system under study.
NOTE 1 Changes in management of land within the same land-use category are not considered land use change.
The net changes in soil and biomass carbon stocks shall be assigned to the system under study across 
the selected time period.
The time period selected for analysis shall be documented and justified. At a minimum, it shall include 
at least one full rotation period for processes that involve growing crops or trees.
If there is a net increase of soil or biomass carbon due to modified land use practices, the net increase 
shall be included in the CFP and the partial CFP only if measures are in place to address its permanence. 
If a national approach is used, the data shall be based on a verified study, a peer reviewed study or 
similar scientific evidence and shall be documented in the CFP study report.
NOTE 2 National approaches can include government ‑recognized and published methods and calculators.
NOTE 3 Ongoing land use can lead to a net increase or decrease of soil carbon, e.g. decrease during drought.
NOTE 4 There is ongoing research to develop methodology and models, and provide data for the inclusion of 
soil carbon change in GHG reporting.
NOTE 5 There are various ways to mitigate the risks of non-permanence of soil and biomass carbon, such as 
buffers and reserve accounts.
NOTE 6 If detection of soil carbon change involves direct field measurement, results depend on variables, 
including the location of sampling sites, the number of replicate soil samples, the timing of sampling, the depth of 
the soil profile and the sampling techniques. The principles and rules for designing soil sampling strategies and 
techniques are provided in ISO 10381 (all parts).

6.4.9.7 Aircraft GHG emissions
Aircraft transportation GHG emissions shall be included in the CFP and documented separately in the 
CFP study report.
Where an aviation multiplier is used, the effect of this multiplier shall not be included in the CFP and 
shall be reported separately together with the source.
NOTE Aircraft GHG emissions under certain circumstances in high altitudes have additional climate impacts 
as a result of physical and chemical reactions with the atmosphere. For more information on GHG emissions from 
aircraft, see the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories [17] and the IPCC Special Report on 
Aviation[18].

6.5 Impact assessment for CFP or partial CFP
6.5.1 General
In the LCIA phase of a CFP study, the potential climate change impact of each GHG emitted and removed 
by the product system shall be calculated by multiplying the mass of GHG released or removed by 
the 100-year GWP given by the IPCC in units of kg CO2e per kg emission (with carbon feedbacks, 
according to IPCC).
NOTE 1 The CFP is the sum of these calculated impacts.
Where GWP values are amended by the IPCC, the latest values shall be used in the CFP calculations if 
not otherwise stated and justified.
GWP for other time horizons and GTP, as given by the IPCC, may be used in addition to GWP 100 but 
should be reported separately.
NOTE 2 100-year global warming potential (GWP 100) is used to represent shorter-term impacts of climate 
change, reflecting the rate of warming. 100-year global temperature potential (GTP 100) is used as an indicator for 
the longer-term impacts of climate change, reflecting the long-term temperature rise. There is no scientific basis 
for choosing a 100-year time horizon compared to other time horizons. The time horizon is a value judgement of 
international convention that weighs the effects that are likely to occur over different time horizons. This text 
has been adapted from Reference [ 17].
6.5.2 Impact assessment of biogenic carbon
Removals of CO2 into biomass shall be characterized in the LCIA as −1 kg CO2e/kg CO2 in the calculation 
of the CFP when entering the product system.
Emissions of biogenic CO 2 shall be characterized as +1 kg CO 2e/kg CO 2 of biogenic carbon in the 
calculation of the CFP.
NOTE The amount of CO 2 taken up in biomass and the equivalent amount of CO 2 emissions from the 
biomass at the point of complete oxidation results in zero net CO 2 emissions integrated over time, except when 
biomass carbon is not converted into methane, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) or other 
precursor gases.
For fossil and biogenic methane, the characterization factors in accordance with the most recent IPCC 
report shall be used.
6.6 Interpretation of CFP or partial CFP
The life cycle interpretation phase of a CFP study shall comprise the following steps:
a) identification of the significant issues based on the results of the quantification of the CFP and 
partial CFP in accordance with LCI and LCIA phases;
NOTE 1 Significant issues can be life cycle stages, unit processes or flows.
b) an evaluation that considers completeness, consistency and sensitivity analysis;
c) the formulation of conclusions, limitations and recommendations.
The results of the quantification of the CFP and partial CFP according to the LCI or LCIA phases shall be 
interpreted according to the goal and scope of the CFP study. The interpretation shall:
— include an assessment of uncertainty, including the application of rounding rules or ranges;
— identify and document the selected allocation procedures in the CFP study report in detail;
— identify the limitations of the CFP study (in accordance with, but not limited to, Annex A).

The interpretation should include:
— a sensitivity analysis of the significant inputs, outputs and methodological choices, including 
allocation procedures, in order to understand the sensitivity and uncertainty of the results;
— an assessment of the influence of alternative use profiles on the final result;
— an assessment of the influence of different end-of-life scenarios on the final result;
— an assessment of the consequences of recommendations [see 6.6 c)] on the final result.

7 CFP study report
7.1 General
The purpose of the CFP study report is to describe the CFP study, including the CFP or the partial CFP, 
and to demonstrate that the provisions of this document have been met.
Results reported in the CFP study report may be used in footprint communications (see ISO 14026).
NOTE “CFP study report” is a specific term relating to the carbon footprint of products. Other standards 
use different terminology for the same type of document (e.g. “third-party report” used in ISO 14044:2006 and 
“footprint study report” used in ISO 14026).
The results and conclusions of the CFP study shall be documented in the CFP study report without bias. 
The results, data, methods, assumptions and the life cycle interpretation (see 6.6) shall be transparent 
and presented in sufficient detail to allow the reader to comprehend the complexities and trade-offs 
inherent in the CFP study.
The type and format of the CFP study report shall be defined in the goal and scope definition phase of 
the CFP study. The CFP study report shall also allow the results and life cycle interpretation to be used 
in a manner consistent with the goals of the CFP study.
7.2 GHG values in the CFP study report
Results of the quantification of the CFP or the partial CFP shall be documented in the CFP study report 
in mass of CO2e per functional or declared unit.
The following GHG values shall be documented separately in the CFP study report:
a) GHG emissions and removals linked to the main life cycle stages in which they occur, including the 
absolute and the relative contribution of each life cycle stage;
b) net fossil GHG emissions and removals (see 6.4.9.2);
c) biogenic GHG emissions and removals (see 6.4.9.2);
d) GHG emissions and removals resulting from dLUC (see 6.4.9.5);
e) GHG emissions resulting from aircraft transportation (see 6.4.9.7).
The following GHG values shall be documented separately in the CFP study report, if calculated:
— GHG emissions and removals occurring as a result of iLUC (see 6.4.9.5);
— GHG emissions and removals occurring as a result of land use (see 6.4.9.6);
— results of the sensitivity analysis applying the relevant consumption grid mix, when applicable;
— biogenic carbon content of products;
